# Aragon Open Design System

Aragon Open Design System (Aragon ODS) is an open source and human-centric design system specifically designed for the Aragon App.
It provides a unified and easy-to-use framework for creating visually consistent and engaging interfaces that prioritize
user experience throughout the Aragon ecosystem. Aragon ODS is currently in alpha version, with documentation updates planned for Q2.
The developed components are expected to be available in the coming months.
